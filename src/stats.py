"""Summary statistics for a user-selected date range.

Conventions baked in (verified in tests/test_stats.py):

  - Returns computed from adjusted close via pct_change. yfinance >= 0.2.51
    defaults to auto_adjust=True, so Close is already adjusted.
  - Annualisation base = 252 trading days (NYSE/Nasdaq). 365 is wrong here.
  - CAGR is geometric: (1 + cum_return) ** (252 / n) - 1.
    Never returns.mean() * 252 — that ignores compounding (volatility drag).
  - Volatility uses SAMPLE std (ddof=1) × √252. Matches CFA / Excel STDEV.S.
    Note this is the OPPOSITE convention from Bollinger Bands (which use
    population std, ddof=0) — same calculation, different statistical role.
  - Sharpe ratio assumes rf = 0 by default; the UI must label it as such.
    For a non-zero rf, convert annual to daily via (1 + rf) ** (1/252) - 1,
    NOT rf / 252.
  - Max drawdown is computed on the total-return equity curve (1 + r).cumprod(),
    not on raw prices. Reported as a negative number (or zero).
