"""Data acquisition: yfinance primary with Stooq fallback, disk-cached.

Yahoo's anti-scrape throttles aggressively, so every call is treated as
eventually-failing: chrome impersonation via curl_cffi, exponential backoff,
cache on success, fall back to a direct Stooq CSV download when yfinance
keeps failing.

Key gotchas baked in here:
  - Use curl_cffi.requests.Session(impersonate="chrome124"), NOT requests.Session
    (vanilla requests broke in yfinance 0.2.59).
  - Pin auto_adjust=True explicitly; yfinance changed the default in 0.2.51.
  - Detect failure on empty DataFrame OR all-NaN Close, not just exceptions —
    yfinance often silently returns empty.
  - Cache on disk via diskcache, key = (cache_version, ticker, start, end,
    day_stamp); the day_stamp flips after each day's actual NYSE close (read
    from the XNYS schedule, which handles DST + half-day closes). When the
    requested range includes today AND market is still open, cache is
    bypassed entirely so the user sees fresh intraday data — only finalised
    historical bars get persisted.
  - Stooq fallback uses a direct CSV download via urllib so we don't need
    pandas-datareader (that package imports the removed `distutils` module on
    Python 3.12 and breaks at import time).
